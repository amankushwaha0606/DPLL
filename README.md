There are 4 files present in this Repo. All are related to SAT Solers. These are all writen in C++. You can just download and run on your code editor and also on the online editor.

# naive_algo
It is native implimentation of SAT Solver using native approach. It takes all the possible arguments. So, time conplexity obviously goes exponential. There is one advantage that we can get all possible solutions for the equation. We can also use all this by dividing the variable in half or groups.

# DPLL_clause_learning
SAT Solver using clause learning. There are some bugs in the code as of now. We are trying to fix that.

# DPLL_recursice
This is also SAT Solver but having a larger time complexity.

# concert_CNF_to_DIMAS
This is not a SAT Solver but generally SAT Solver takes input in CNF form and manipulate it in DIMAS form. So this is the converter to do the same.
